                <span class = "first-word">Hey there</span>, I'm Ahmed Wael! 
                I love coding, football, history, reading books, and hanging out with friends. 
                I love learning out new stuff whenever possible or in my free time generally. 
                I graduated high school from Modern School Al-Shorouk in New Cairo. 
                Beyond coding, catch me buried in books, immersed in video games, and occasionally cheering on football matches. 
                Currently, you'll find me diving deep into the world of tech.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently enrolled in the computer science program at Cairo University's Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence. Over the past couple of years, my journey has been all about immersing myself in the world of programming, delving into various programming languages and their unique challenges.
                Python has captured my attention with its simplicity, enabling me to craft elegant and organized code that resonates with the principles of Zen philosophy. On the other hand, C++ has empowered me to engage with hardware at a low level, allowing for exceptional efficiency and control.
                My exploration has extended beyond programming languages to encompass the realm of databases. This has provided me with insights into both the potential they offer and the challenges they present. A pivotal point in my learning was a comprehensive course on data structures, which not only refined my coding skills but also revolutionized my problem-solving approach.
                In the dynamic landscape of technology, observing the dominance of languages like Python and JavaScript has been enlightening. Alongside their prominence, I've encountered Java, which, while undeniably cool, demands a considerable amount of boilerplate code.
                This is a journey I'm fully committed to, driven by unyielding curiosity and a steadfast determination to truly master the craft I've chosen.

                <p>
                <span class="first-word">Over </span>the past months, I started my journey in the world of computers, I started with a CS course
                which was an introduction to computer science, in the course I've learnt fundamentals of programming using Python, computers and numeric convertions as binary, 
                octal, hexadecimal, etc ...<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                After this course I took another course which was structured programming where you learn how to write more complex programs using C++, the approach
                was functional programming and learning pointers, structs, templates and exception handling.
                Later on, I came across object oriented programming course (OOP), it teaches you how to deal with real life objects and add them to your program or system
                as an entity, you also learn polymorphism, abstraction and templates (generic types).<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                I'v also came across Databases course which was very useful, I've seen how databases are much more efficient than file systems, but that comes with expenses
                you are supposed to design a system for your database and different users and views, but overall it was a pretty nice experience
                but SQL Joins are kinda hard to be honest <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i>, I've taken that course with Microsoft SQL Server and C#.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                I also took a Software Engineering course which gives you a more of the bigger picture of the software industry it teaches you how to bridge the gap between
                customers and programmers, as software is just meant to solve different society problems or make it easier, the course also gives you an introduction to
                collaboration tools like github and CI/CD pipelines and so on, the course also includes design patterns, history of software industry and the rise of the need to teach
                new programmers how to write complex software in a correct manner with minimal errors. The problem with large software failures is that it does come with a lot of troubles, 
                millions of dollars wasted, bad reputation for the company that failed to deliver the desired software, and the examples are endless, Therac, The London Ambulance, etc ...
                </p>
                <p>
                The most important course in my opinion for a software engineer is Data Structures & Algorithms, it teaches you the difference between different data representations in the memory, 
                and what data structure to use for each problem you might face, in this course you also learn about different algorithms, as Dijkstra Shortest Path, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, etc ...
                </p>
                <p>
                I started studying web developement on my own, I finished learning and applying HTML & CSS, and I think I'm currently on a good level but I need to take the next steps in my career.

                    I think the next step after that is learning deploying apps, automating your work, using github actions, docker, kubernetes, Jenkinks
                    also and a lot other stuff to learn maybe try an AI track or project, maybe try cross app developement, maybe try game developement, might also try
                    learning a real life skill or building new habits and getting rid of bad habits.
                    It's all about the progress at the end even if it's small. <i class="fa-regular fa-face-grin-wink"></i>
