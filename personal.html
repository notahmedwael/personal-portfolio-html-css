                    I love coding in my free time, I used to open codeforces and solve problems all the day, nowadays I'm busy learning web developement.
                    Throughout the last weeks I've learnt HTML & CSS and I'm using them to write this website from scratch, I am aiming to learn JavaScript, Bootstrap,
                    TailWind CSS, React JS & NEXT JS in my front end journey.
                    Afterwards I'm aiming to learn backend developement, what I'm wondering is to start by PHP & laravel or jump straight forward into Node JS and Express JS,
                    But currently I think I'll jump into MERN stack as it's the trend currently, I would like to try some AI stuff like tensorflow or any object detection project.
                    I also want to write any small/intermediate project in python beacuse the language is very appealing and cool to be honest, hundreds of ready library, easy language.
                    I also want to write in Java as I tried it for my Software Engineering course, alot of boilerplate but such a cool one to be honest, very organized, and I fell in love
                    with design patterns. C++ is the language that feels like the cool grandpa of all other languages, it's crazy how powerful it is, you have low level memory language for 
                    maximum efficiency and you can literally control hardware resources, while at the same time you can write high level oop code with design patterns, the only thing that it needs
                    that adding garbage collection to avoid memory leaks, I think it will make it surpass other leading languages again as it's already popular every year on Tiobe index.
                    But in the industry tech it feels like everybody is shifting towards JavaScript, Python, Flutter and new frameworks like React, next, node and all these fancy JavaScript
                    frameworks, what's crazy about JavaScript is that it was a dead language back till mid first decade in 2000s. Python remains the most loved language in the industry I guess.
                    The language is easy to learn, very powerful and can be used in every possible field with ready libraries and frameworks.

                    In my free time I like to play video games, or watch some video games matches, I used to watch tons of football, now I just watch important matches as I find them kind of boring recently,
                    for most of the matches right now I just watch goals post matches. For video games I used to play PUBG Mobile since it was released but I stopped playing it since like two years.
                    I switched to play Valorant, I like how the game makes you think a lot and not just shoot them, It's like a game of chess in which strategy plays a big role.
                    Watching pro level Valorant is really cool and fun, you learn how a tactical fps is played from the best players out there. From time to time I train my 
                    raw aim to get better mechanically at FPS games, but sadly I have no time to play consistenly, I play a game or two once in a while.
                    Also I like reading a lot, I like reading in History, Economy, I admire novels too. I also listen to Ahmed Younes' horror drama on youtube (audio),
                    I have been listening for these stories for more than 10 years and it has been a pleasure to be honest. I admire listening to podcasts in different fields, 
                    I listen to podcasts in Life, Entrepreunership, Coding, Sport, Religion, Politics, Economy, Podcasts with aspiring people, From time to time I like to download new podcasts and listen
                    to them while cooking, maybe while training my aim, sometimes when I'm coding, when I'm doing routine stuff.

                    <p>
                    In this modern life where everything is quick even the people have no patience to learn and we have a serious short span of attention problem, people are now addicted to short
                    reels like youtube shorts, instagram & facebook reels, tiktoks, this is a huge problem if you are not controlling the amount of time you are exposed to this, your attention span gets smaller
                    and smaller till you can't even complete short reels because your brain has adapted to quick shots of dopamine and always wants more dopamine, we need to train ourselves 
                    on lower dopamine levels satisfaction so we can reward ourselves with small achievements in everyday life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Also there is another problem which is people not putting the work-life balance as a priority, they keep stressing themselves in learning new stuff or working on projects, this is not healthy at all.
                    Suppose that when you are sitting on your desk doing your job and not distracted by anything like open tabs on your browser, or your phone, or whatever, then the extra unhealthy effort you're putting might make
                    you think that you are more productive, maybe that's on the short term, but for the long term you will 100% be worse mentally, more stressed, not behaving like your normal self, this is beacuse
                    you are burning yourself out. You have to put the balance in life between work and studying and whatever we are doing for a good career, and our life which is our relationship with our god, 
                    our relationship with close relatives and friends, going out from time to time to smell fresh air, going to gym. As long as you live you should keep the balance so you don't get burnout.
                    If you get burnout, you will become lazy, not willing to work or study, doing nothing basically throughout your day. Balance it out to live a happy life.
